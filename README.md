# Binary Search In C++
- In Binary Search , we look for the key in the middle of the list , if we get a match , the search will be over.
- If the key is greater than the element of the list , we make the Top(upper)half of the list to search.
- If the key is smaller , we make the bottom(lower) half of the list to search.
- Repeat the above steps , until one element remains.
